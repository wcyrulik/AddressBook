# AddressBook

 This is a full stack Addressbook C# ASP.net MVC application.  The app was developed
 as part of the Coder Foundry self-paced online training.  

 Current Status of the application:

 The application is far from complete.  The list view of contacts is working, and the 
 create view is working.  The other views were scafolded based on the Entity Framework
 model.  

 Demonstrated in this project:

 1.  Use of Entity Framework code first database integration with a Postgress database.

 2.  Utilization of the scafolding capabilities to create a CRUD application based on a model.

 3.  Utilization of an image service to convert images to and from a byte array.

 4.  Added additional table formatting with datatables.net js and css libraries.
